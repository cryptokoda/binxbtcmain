So a lot of talk revolves, jokingly, around memecoins and their community as being cult like. I'm not a big fan of that being mildly faithful. I see how it could be construed as such but literally if that is the case then where does the line start/stop. Can a knitting group be a cult? How about an improv-class? 

Anyway, crypto market looks great and strong. More than ATHs and pumps/runs, I think the sign of a solid market is both the ups AND the downs. Ebb/Flow. The more stable a currency is the more likely for mass adoption.

Why are memecoins more likely to bring higher onboarding potential and growth? I know a lot of maxis hate conversing about and even reject those that talk about utility but it's a necessary truth. Why can a baseball card be worth more than a bat that the player used? Community is a pretty great factor I think, it's easier to get behind something with a symbol and the more agreeable the symbol the more likely for adoption. 

I will give it to Gen Z though. Well done on creating the meme. Millenials may have built it for yall but man meme's are a banger.
