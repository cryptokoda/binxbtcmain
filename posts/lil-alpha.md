What started as light conversation became a good look at the future of finance! See below!

"Once cash crumbles, all of this withers to irrelevance and a #BTC #sBTC peer 2 peer world emerges. 

Vendors and individuals will seek #BTC #sBTC as payment. 
 
The Amazons of the world would embed web3 wallets, therefore .btc and all the traditional namespaces will work just fine and better empower individual sovereignty. 

Paul Tudor, Billy-naire, today on CNBC said he has 0 fixed income. Its gold and #Bitcoin for him. If he does have cash its very short term to convert to gold or Bitcoin. 

Cash is the tentacle to centralization. But, if no one desires it because the purchasing power instantly erodes as a result of the money printer.............. well........

Its coming."

"yup, i told my madre if the government closed their doors tomorrow and a few months roll by and bread starts to cost 100usd (remember toilet paper during covid?) those same markets will begin to accept crypto for payment and she only knows me and two others that hold crypto"

"Yep. People still think cash is backed by gold. They dont understand basic economics. They are being stolen from via inflation and itll get worse. Eventually, it doesnt make sense to hold cash. 

Only then will they realize a medium of exchange can be anything as long as theres consensus on trusting it. 

And that my friends......is how Bitcoin emerges. A globally transactable, decentralized, divisible, finite supply, transparent ledger system, called #Bitcoin."

Such valuable info and very true! My Mom was still under the impression that the dollar is backed by gold. Once upon a time absolutely but the dollar is not backed by gold and it is also a dying commodity. Embrace Bitcoin and let's retake our financial freedom!
