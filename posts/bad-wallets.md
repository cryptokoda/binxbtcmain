Let me set the scene. It's late.. real late.. some consider early. I see an x post about someone new to the STX ecosystem. SCORE! They explained how they had just setup their wallet and were excited for their future on the stacks ecosystem. 

I think to myself well I could just reply to their post saying welcome.... but I would like to do more because their x name was .eth (yuck, jk) so I go out to bns and purchase their btc name and decide to send to them. I ask them what their wallet is (in the feed) and they reply with their address. I ship that thing off and head to bed cause i'm exhausted.

Big oof, I wake up to find that... yup... the poster deleted their comment and they had just phished us. He had spoofed their account perfectly and in my barely awake ignorance had just sent the bns to some bot account. RIP

So ofcourse I apologized and hey what can i do. Learning curve I guess. So for the sake of learning I'm going to update the end of this very blog entry and I will KEEP it updated with any bad wallets/accounts I find so going forward it's easier to avoid.
